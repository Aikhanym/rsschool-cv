About Me:
-----------
Now my main purpose is to become a demanded specialist in IT, specifically - FrontEnd developer. And when will I get enough experience I will share my knowledge with juniors. I like teaching. 
Before the last of our high school year, I was confident, that I can never write codes and IT is not for me. But, due to coronavirus, I grasped that IT has a bright future and coding isn't boring incomprehensible mathematical symbols, contrary coding is a creative craft.

Now I'm sure that everyone can learn to program if they really want it and see an exact target and of course self-confidence plays a big role.
